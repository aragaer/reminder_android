#### Why is it special?

It is designed to be easy to use. It is designed to be used on the go. It is designed to be visible.

The last part is important. Memos are not something you should be able to ignore easily. I used to make notes on the back of my own hand to always be able to see it and remind myself of something. This turned into idea of placing memos directly into notification bar. Since my initial method of creating memos involved drawing just a symbol or two, this is how the application works now.

Another thing about memos is that they are fleeting not in that they can be easily created but they are also not intended to stay for a long time. It is something you should remember to do today or tomorrow or this week at most. Having a memo staying longer means you have more memos on average and thus you might start ignoring something (especially long-present ones) which defeats the purpose of the application.

#### Only symbol?

Nope, the symbol alone is a way to quickly recall something you want to remember. Sometimes you need some extra information ("What that X means? Should I go to store or wake up earlier than usual?") that's why there's also a way to add textual description. But in future the following features are planned:
- Alarm to set up - will trigger either at a time or after some interval.
- Photo - attach a photo or a few to your memo
- Audio - add an audio recording
- Export - export your memo to some other application
